# Both hosts' /usr/local/bin/sd are user-writable (the file, not the dir), so no
# sudo is needed. We overwrite the file in place with `cat >` rather than mv:
# /usr/local/bin is root-owned, so a cross-device mv (from /tmp) can't unlink the
# target, but writing through the existing writable file works. Version is
# stamped from `git describe` so `sd version` is meaningful.

# Usage: ./deploy.sh [host ...]     (default: all hosts below)
#
# Kept portable to bash 3.2 (macOS default): no associative arrays.
